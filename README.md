# Koala 

First of all, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity, and I  appreciate it. I have to say that I had lots of fun doing this test. Because I still need to do my regular job during the week, so I spent most of the nights to complete the test. 

The first part like a warm-up exercise and it didn't take too much time at all, and I only put my answers in here in case someone else may accidentally see the question.  

Like what I expected that most of the fun comes from doing the weather widget project, and I put a great effort into the project and try to design and complete it as a production-grade application. Like all the other projects, there is always something that could be improved, but I am happy to release it now as a beta version.

I really hope you guys like it too and look forward to hearing from you about it.
